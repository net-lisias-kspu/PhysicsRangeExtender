# Physics Range Extender :: Changes

* 2018-0620: 1.7.0 (jrodrigv) for KSP 1.4.3
	+ v1.7.0
	+ Recompiled and upgraded for KSP 1.4.3
	+ Adding option to extend terrain loading distance (thanks to Gedas). So there is no need of statics anymore!
	+ Flickering fixed at 99% after applying a dynamic update of the near clip plane of the main camera.
	+ Landed range removed, only one range is needed now :)
