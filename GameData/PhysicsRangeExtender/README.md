# PhysicsRangeExtender
This is a KSP mod based on a piece of code written by BahamutoD for BDArmory and improved by myself. 

Basically it extends game physics range(1)! This will allow you to switch between vessel that are far away or even to see an orbital station from a flying plane.

There a settings file inside the mod folder called settings.cfg. By default the ranges are the following in Kilometers.

RangeForLandedVessels = 10 
- Be careful changing this value, if your landed vessel sits on normal terrain it will collide as soon as you pass the 10 km barrier. The work around is to place your vessel on static objects (Runways, KSC buildings, Kerbal Konstructs..)
	

GlobalRange = 100
The default range for the rest of the scenarios.



(1) This is an experimental mod, if you extend the ranges to something extreme like 2000 km. You might experience ultra phantom forces applied to your vessel when switching between orbital and suborbital vessels. Also, mods like Mechjeb or TCA can behave wrongly due to this  physics ranges.
